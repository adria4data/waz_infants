# weight_infants_project

The objective of the present study was to explore the relationship between infants’ weight and various demographics (i.e., infants’ mother location, marital status, social economic status, and age; and infants beingborn on term, age, anemia status, rank into the family and dietary patterns).

Identifying the connection between such factors could help practitioners in developing public health policies andinterventions in Romania.
